Question 2:

    extraLargeArray:
    insert 639.5101 ms
    append 2.5018 ms

    Results for the largeArray
    insert 6.7085 ms
    append 424.8 μs

    Results for the mediumArray
    insert 152.4 μs
    append 114 μs

    Results for the smallArray
    insert 54 μs
    append 94.9 μs

    Results for the tinyArray
    insert 34.6 μs
    append 86.4 μs

Question 3:
    as the size of the array shrinks it takes less time to edit it because it doesn't have to load as much data into it. The best ones for scale would be mediumArray and smallArray because
    these allow you to put in more data without affecting the append speed that much compared to the tinyArray. On the other hand it is still way faster than the largeArray or extraLargeArray.
    The way we can see this is by comparing all the append speeds of each array.
